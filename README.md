# First Contact Android app

![alt text](./FirstContact.png "First Contact Logo")

First Contact was build to help people to notify each other about their contagious status.

In our development strategy, we splitted the project in 3 stages:
- <b>Stage 1:</b> The development of a prototype app, based on a heavily modified version of the <a href="https://bluetrace.io/Bluetrace">BlueTrace protocol</a>, that has been changed to follow a fully descentralized, privacy-centric model. 
- <b>Stage 2:</b> Public release of a prototype version, in order to demostrate the viability of the concept and the fact that a privacy-centric, decentralised, Bluetooth based contact warning is the best solution.
- <b>Stage 3:</b> Adjusting the application's architecture, so it can fulfill its intended role (to warn users in case of exposure), without any interference with the romanian authorities.
